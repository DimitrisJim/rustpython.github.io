One of the goals of this project is to learn about writing interpreters. This is a space for contributors to share what they learned and to communicate the details of the RustPython implementation. You can contribute by using a pull request. By taking the time to write things down, we hope that you get an opportunity to reflect and clarify your own thought processes.
